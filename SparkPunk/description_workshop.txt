[h1] Try new ways to play mage class [/h1]
This mod reworks some mage class mechanics and items to make it more enjoyable and balanced throughout the whole progression.
It is mostly inspired by Throarbin's video about fixing mage class so all credits to him

[*] It's recreational project so I'm not promising any consistent updates, however I will try

[h2] list of changes: [/h2]

Demon scythe
[*]Damage increased from 35 to 48
[*]No longer drops from demons and voodoo demons
[*]Now can be found in shadow chests with 66% chance (may change)

Flower of fire
[*]Can be crafted after obtaining meteorite instead of being found in shadow chests
[*]Highly nerfed to match it's current recipe and simple projectile AI so now fits better between Wand of sparking and Flower of frost progression
[*]Wand of sparking is now needed to craft it

Wand of sparking
[*]Can be now crafted from wood and torches near workbench so it is guaranteed to get on every world as copper shortsword direct alternative


Jungle armor
[*]shadow scale/tissue sample added to crafting making it obtainable after defeating evil boss

Gem staves / Gem robes
[*] Rebalanced to match each other on the same tier (for example ruby stuff has same stats as diamond stuff)
[*] Crafting recipes require less gems so making those sets is not that tedious and not-worth
[*] Staves now can be crafted from alternative ores (for ruby staff you can use platinum instead of gold)
[*] Greatly increased projectile speed of staves - 2x (Topaz/Amethyst), 2.5x (Emerald/Sapphire), 3x (Ruby/Diamond)

Gem tiaras
[*] Added new head pieces for matching robes - Tiaras as counterpart of wizard hat and magic hat
[*] Also can be crafted from alternative ores
[*] Gives set bonus depending on gem rarity
[*] Made as an alternative that doesn't need endless Tim hunting or waiting for travelling merchant to appear

Starfury
[*] returned magic damage
[*] damage balances: weapon 25 -> 28, projectile x1.5 -> 35
[*] enabled autoswing

New Accessories
[*] Apprentice cloak (pre-boss/post-EoC) - gives magic damage boost depending on how much mana you have left
[*] Magic glove (early hardmode) - increases speed of magic weapons
[*] Stellar shield - WIP
[*] Stellar emblem (post-mechs) - combines Avenger emblem with Mana flower
[*] Star-thorned necklace - Enemies have chance to drop mana per hit instead of kill

Smaller tweaks
[*] Crimson rod damage: 12 -> 18


note: maybe gonna add Czech/Polish localization if I get bored lol
